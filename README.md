This software takes urls from news sites and scraps them. It will download each news article put them into their own individual text file.
It is recommended to take articles from the same news site because the program requires the div class from the sites html.
When you have found your article place them into a text file and find the div class for the body of the article. Depending on the website this could be a little challenging.
After you find the div class go into the program and place the name of the text file with your articles into the program, this should be on line 37.
Place the name of the div class into the program, this should be on line 11.
If the program has an error you have gotten the wrong div class name.
